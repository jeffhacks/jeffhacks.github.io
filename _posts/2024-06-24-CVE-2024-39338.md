Axios is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery attack caused by unexpected behaviour where requests for path relative URLs get processed as protocol relative URLs.

## Access Control Bypass in Axios
- Affected Vendor: Axios - https://axios-http.com/
- Affected Software: Axios HTTP Client
- Affected Version: Tested on 1.3.2 and 1.7.3
- Issue type: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Release Date: 24 June 2024
- Discovered by: Jeff Thomas - https://jeffhacks.com
- CVE Identifier: CVE-2024-39338

## Summary

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests in both browser and Node.js environments. Axios is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery attack caused by unexpected behaviour where requests for path relative URLs get processed as protocol relative URLs.

### Impact

This could be leveraged by an attacker to perform arbitrary requests from the server, potentially accessing internal systems or exfiltrating sensitive data.

### To Reproduce

In this vulnerable code snippet, the developer intended to invoke a path relative to the base URL, however it allows an attacker to craft a malicious protocol-relative URL which is then requested by the server. Given protocol-relative URLs are not relevant server-side as there is no protocol to be relative to, the expected result would be an error. Instead, a valid URL is produced and requested.

Example Vulnerable Code
```typescript
const axios = require('axios');

this.axios = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://userapi.example.com',
});

//userId = '12345';
userId = '/google.com'

this.axios.get(`/${userId}`).then(function (response) {
  console.log(`config.baseURL:  ${response.config.baseURL}`);
  console.log(`config.method:   ${response.config.method}`);
  console.log(`config.url:      ${response.config.url}`);
  console.log(`res.responseUrl: ${response.request.res.responseUrl}`);
});
```

Expected Output (Prior to axios 1.3.2):
```typescript
(node:10243) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL]: Invalid URL: //example.org
```

Developer might also have expected:
```yaml
config.baseURL:  https://userapi.example.com
config.method:   get
config.url:      https://userapi.example.com//www.google.com/
res.responseUrl: https://userapi.example.com//www.google.com/
```

Observed Output:
```yaml
config.baseURL:  https://userapi.example.com
config.method:   get
config.url:      //google.com
res.responseUrl: http://www.google.com/
```

This behaviour is potentially unexpected and introduces the potential for attackers to request URLs on arbitrary hosts other than the host in the base URL.

The code related to parsing and preparing the URL for server-side requests, prior to version 1.3.2, only passed one argument to the Node.js URL class.
```typescript
    const fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url);
    const parsed = new URL(fullPath);
    const protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];
```

Version 1.3.2 introduced `http://localhost` as a base URL for relative paths (https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/5458)
```typescript
    const fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url);
    const parsed = new URL(fullPath, 'http://localhost');
    const protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];
```

As protocol-relative URLs are considered to be absolute, the config.baseURL value is ignored so protocol-relative URLs are passed to the URL class without a protocol. The node.js URL class will then prepend the protocol from `'http://localhost'` to the protocol-relative URL.

For example
```typescript
> new URL('//google.com', 'https://example.org');
URL {
  href: 'https://google.com/',
  ...
}

> new URL('//google.com', 'file://example.org');
URL {
  href: 'file://google.com/',
  ...
}
```

### Expected behavior

An error could be raised when attempting to request protocol-relative URLs server-side as unlike in a client-side browser session, there is no established protocol to be relative to.

### Affected Versions

All versions from 1.3.2
